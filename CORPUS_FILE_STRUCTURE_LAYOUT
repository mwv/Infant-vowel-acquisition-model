The code here assumes the following file structure layout. 
If you want to run the code without modifying it, you need to set up (symbolic) links to your corpora like this:

/data
  /ifa
    /textgrids
      /F20N
      ...
    /wavs
      /F20N
      ...
  /CELEX
    /DUTCH
      /DPW
        /DPW.CD
        ..
      ..
    ..
  /childes
    /BolKuiken
      /.cha files
    ..
  /cgn
    /wav
    /textgrids
/vowels
  README
  COPYING
  /src
  ...
  (i.e. this project)
  
If needed I might change the code in the future to take filepaths as arguments, for more flexibility.
