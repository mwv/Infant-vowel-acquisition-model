Extract frequency and acoustic similarity information from infant- and adult-directed speech.

To run the example for extracting frequency counts I sent around:
- make sure you have python2.7+ installed
- install bidict from pypi (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bidict/0.1.1) if you haven't already
- set up your file paths as outlined in CORPUS_FILE_STRUCTURE_LAYOUT
- run frequency_extractor.py script in /src directory

To use any of the audio measurement, clustering or classification functions, make sure you have the following:
- numpy and scipy (http://numpy.scipy.org/), linear algebra functions and scientific computing libraries
- matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/), plotting library
- sklearn (http://scikit-learn.org/), machine learning library
- for the formant measurements, I've used Praat. Make sure that python can call it, i.e. 'praat' should be in your PATH.
  (For OSX: the Praat program installs to /Applications/Audio/Praat.app/Contents/MacOS/Praat, which is not in the PATH by default.
    Easiest way to solve that is to put a symlink in /usr/bin to there, i.e. open a Terminal and do
    $ sudo ln -s /Applications/Audio/Praat.app/Contents/MacOS/Praat /usr/bin/praat 
   For Linux: Praat installs to /usr/bin by default, so you don't have to do anything.
   For Windows: god knows.)
